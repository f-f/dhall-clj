    to the indices of all variables named `x` whose indices are greater than
    `(+ n m)`, where `m` is the number of bound variables of the same name
    within that scope.
    `diff` is always +1 or -1, because we either:
    * increment variables by `1` to avoid variable capture during substitution
    * decrement variables by `1` when deleting lambdas after substitution")

;;   Implementation note: the classes here are basically the constructors
;;   of the Expr type that the Haskell implementation has in Dhall.Core
;;
;;   However, two constructors are missing here:
;;
;;   - `Note`: this is used there for keeping track of the source position.
;;     Here we use the metadata on nodes for that.
;;
;;   - `Embed`: it's there to make extending the type nice there, while
;;     keeping type safety. Here we just hope we have enough tests :)
